# <span style="color: #ff0f0f;">Steam Marketplace Setup</span>
The mod.io SDK supports full monetization features, allowing you sell a per-game virtual currency to your players that
they can use to purchase mods, with a share of the revenue split between creators and your studio. Every platform 
requires specific setup for monetization features to work, with regards to the virtual currency configuration and API 
calls. The following documentation walks you through the setup process and gives example usages. The mod.io monetization
features are enabled as part of the onboarding process on your game profile. Once that is setup, there is nothing 
further you need to do for initialization in the SDK.

There are two packages that are typically used to integrate steamworks into Unity: Facepunch and Steamworks.Net.
Steamworks.Net is closer to the actual C++ implementation. Facepunch is more user friendly and takes advantage
of C# libraries.

### Sync Entitlements
Synchronizes purchased virtual currency packs through the Steam Store with the mod.io server. This must be called to update the user's
balance after purchasing virtual currency packs. This is done for you automatically in FetchUpdates() but can be called manually 
if needed.
```csharp
async void SyncEntitlements()
{
    var response = await ModIOUnityAsync.SyncEntitlements();
    if(response.result.Succeeded())
    {
        Debug.Log("Virtual currency packs have been added to user's balance");
    }
}
```
